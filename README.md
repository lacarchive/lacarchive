### Los Angeles Contemporary Archive (LACA) 

- An art archive, library, and exhibition platform that collects underexposed artistic modes of expression happening in our current moment
- A unique experimental environment for critical inquiry, artistic research, and public dialogue that challenges established concepts of the archive and art space
- Artistâ€“run, meaning that living artists are donating, deciding what is valuable and generating language for inventorying their work on their own terms
- Not affiliated with a larger institution and as such, it maintains an archive free from limitations associated with prevailing, traditional structures
